# Kraken 2 experiment code

Code used to download data, simulate reads, build databases, and run comparisons in the Kraken 2 manuscript.

The `README_DataGeneration.md` file contains information on how the data
backing the strain exclusion experiments were downloaded and created.

The `BuildScripts` directory contains scripts for building the
various classifiers' databases with our strain exclusion data.

The `ExecutionScripts` directory contains scripts for running
the classifiers in our accuracy and performance experiments.

The `Utilities` directory contains tools used by the other
scripts in this repository.

Each directory has its own `README.md` file with further information
relevant to the files it contains.
