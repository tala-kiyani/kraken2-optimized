# Utilities used by the various scripts in this repository

Most of these are Perl scripts, with the exception of the
evaluate\_calls program which is written in C++ (for speed).

The evaluate\_calls program should be buildable by simply running
"make" in this directory, provided you have a fairly recent
version of GCC installed.
